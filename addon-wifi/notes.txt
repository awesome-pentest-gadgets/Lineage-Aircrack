Aircrack Binaries Addon

A functioning, signed add on package that can be sideloaded when flashing LineageOS:

addonwifi-signed.zip 

In the event of issues, my original creation notes have been included:

How to create a new addon package:

1) Copy wanted files to mirror directory under addonNAME/system/
2) Go to addonNAME/META-INF/com/google/android/ and update updater-script
   to tell android how to place and set the files from system/
3) Zip contents of addonNAME/* (make sure addonNAME root does NOT get included)
4) Sign the package with private keys in addon-certs:
   java -jar addon-certs/signapk.jar addon-certs/certificate.pem addon-certs/key.pk8    addonNAME-unsign.zip addonNAME-signed.zip
   NOTE: java may need to be changed to jdk8

Maybe create a script to automate everything after putting the files into system/xbin/
